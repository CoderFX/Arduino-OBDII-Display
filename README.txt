This is a simple project I created because I wanted an inexpensive 
OBD-II display for my Ford F250 Diesel. 

Yes, I know the code is not "Optimized" and is "Ugly". So what.
It works for me. Feel free to copy and clean-up for your own use. :)

This project uses an Arduino (MightyCore Mega1284p), a SparkFun OBD-II adapter and a 2.4" Nextion display.
 
Hope you find it useful. If not, well at least it was free!
